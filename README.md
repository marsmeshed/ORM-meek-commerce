# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description

Here is my 13th module! This module demonstrates databases. As a user, you're able to hold different categories then delete, update and more with each category. Through this project I was able to better understand SQL as a whole.

## Installation

Run the server using node to access JS outside of the JS files, then open it using Insomnia. After the project has been opened, access it within your localhost.

## Usage
